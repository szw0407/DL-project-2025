  abstract     = {In this commentary, we describe the current state of the art of points of interest ({POIs}) as digital, spatial datasets, both in terms of their quality and affordings, and how they are used across research domains. We argue that good spatial coverage and high-quality {POI} features — especially {POI} category and temporality information — are key for creating reliable data. We list challenges in {POI} geolocation and spatial representation, data fidelity, and {POI} attributes, and address how these challenges may affect the results of geospatial analyses of the built environment for applications in public health, urban planning, sustainable development, mobility, community studies, and sociology. This commentary is intended to shed more light on the importance of {POIs} both as standalone spatial datasets and as input to geospatial analyses.},

  abstract  = {Machine learning is one of the fastest growing areas of computer science, with far-reaching applications. The aim of this textbook is to introduce machine learning, and the algorithmic paradigms it offers, in a principled way. The book provides an extensive theoretical account of the fundamental ideas underlying machine learning and the mathematical derivations that transform these principles into practical algorithms. Following a presentation of the basics of the field, the book covers a wide array of central topics that have not been addressed by previous textbooks. These include a discussion of the computational complexity of learning and the concepts of convexity and stability; important algorithmic paradigms including stochastic gradient descent, neural networks, and structured output learning; and emerging theoretical concepts such as the PAC-Bayes approach and compression-based bounds. Designed for an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate course, the text makes the fundamentals and algorithms of machine learning accessible to students and non-expert readers in statistics, computer science, mathematics, and engineering.}

  abstract     = {As most real-world networks evolve over time, link prediction over such dynamic networks has become a challenging issue. Recent researches focus towards network embedding to improve the performance of link prediction task. Most of the network embedding methods are only applicable to static networks and therefore cannot capture the temporal variations of dynamic networks. In this work, we propose a time-aware network embedding method which generates node embeddings by capturing the temporal dynamics of evolving networks. Unlike existing works which use deep architectures, we design an evolving skip-gram architecture to create dynamic node embeddings. We use the node embedding similarities between consecutive snapshots to construct a univariate time series of node similarities. Further, we use times series forecasting using auto regressive integrated moving average ({ARIMA}) model to predict the future links. We conduct experiments using dynamic network snapshot datasets from various domains and demonstrate the advantages of our system compared to other state-of-the-art methods. We show that, combining network embedding with time series forecasting methods can be an efficient solution to improve the quality of link prediction in dynamic networks.},
